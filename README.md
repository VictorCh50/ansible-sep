🚀 Ansible Automation Project – Infrastructure Configuration & Management

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Ansible can be used to automate infrastructure configuration, application deployment, and operational tasks across Linux servers in a repeatable, scalable, and secure manner.

The goal of this project was to eliminate manual configuration, reduce human error, and ensure consistent environments across development, UAT, and production systems.

🎯 Objectives
  - Automate server configuration and application setup
  - Enforce consistent system baselines
  - Improve deployment speed and reliability
  - Support scalable infrastructure operations
  - Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to configuration management

🛠 Key Features & Tasks Automated
  - Server hardening and baseline configuration
  - User and access management
  - Package installation and updates
  - Application deployment and configuration
  - Service management (start/stop/restart)
  - Environment standardization across multiple hosts
